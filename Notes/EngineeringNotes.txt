SQLite Engineering Notes

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SnowLeopard/SQLite 3.6.x changes 

The configure script as distributed doesn't work properly with Mac OS X and needs to be updated via

% cd public_source/ 
% aclocal
% glibtoolize -f -c
% autoconf -f

These commands only need to be issued if you've grabbed a fresh copy of the sqlite public sources.
