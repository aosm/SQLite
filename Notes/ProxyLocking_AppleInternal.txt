SQLite proxy file locking (Apple Internal Notes)

--

For testing purposes, a compile-time switch (-DSQLITE_PREFER_PROXY_LOCKING) enables proxy locking for all database files accessed via network file systems.  With this compile-time setting, automatic proxy locking can be forced on or off for all files regardless of file system by setting the environment variable SQLITE_FORCE_PROXY_LOCKING=0 (or 1)

This is a temporary arrangement and we will not ship sqlite in that configuration.  Clients will be required to manually set up proxy locking via one of the following:
