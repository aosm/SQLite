# To roll back a hot-journal file, the application needs read and write 
# permission on the journal file in question. The following tests test
# the outcome of trying to rollback a hot-journal file when this is not
# the case.
# 
#   tkt3457-1.2: Application has neither read, nor write permission on
#                the hot-journal file. Result: SQLITE_CANTOPEN.
#                
#   tkt3457-1.3: Application has write but not read permission on
#                the hot-journal file. Result: SQLITE_CANTOPEN.
#
#   tkt3457-1.4: Application has read but not write permission on
#                the hot-journal file. Result: SQLITE_CANTOPEN.
#
#   tkt3457-1.5: Application has read/write permission on the hot-journal 
#                file. Result: SQLITE_OK.
